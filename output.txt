===== Setting a Bash Variable =====

You can set a Bash variable called ''%%FOLK_SHARE_NODE%%'' to the string ''%%folk-convivial%%'' in several ways:

==== Temporary (Within Current Session) ====

  * Open your terminal.
  * Type the following command: ''%%bash     export FOLK_SHARE_NODE="folk-convivial"%%''
  * This will set the variable only for the current session.

==== Permanently (Across Sessions) ====

=== Using .bashrc or .bash_profile ===

  * Open your ''%%.bashrc%%'' (Linux) or ''%%.bash_profile%%'' (macOS) file in a text editor. You can use ''%%nano%%'' or ''%%vim%%'' for this. ''%%bash     nano ~/.bashrc  # for Linux     nano ~/.bash_profile  # for macOS%%''
  * Add the following line at the end of the file: ''%%bash     export FOLK_SHARE_NODE="folk-convivial"%%''
  * Save and exit the editor.
  * Run the following command to make the change effective: ''%%bash     source ~/.bashrc  # for Linux     source ~/.bash_profile  # for macOS%%''

=== Using ~/.profile (For System-wide Usage) ===

  * Open the ''%%~/.profile%%'' file. ''%%bash     nano ~/.profile%%''
  * Add the export line as above: ''%%bash     export FOLK_SHARE_NODE="folk-convivial"%%''
  * Save and exit, then run ''%%source ~/.profile%%''.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll be able to set the ''%%FOLK_SHARE_NODE%%'' Bash variable to the desired value either temporarily or permanently.
